# Audio Satanizer 666 Mini

## About

Turn any audio file you have into the Devil itself. Easy and fast. Hail Satan.


## Features

- Processes everything locally, your audio never leaves your machine. It stays in hell. Forever.
- Accepts '.wav', '.mp3', '.ogg', '.flac', '.m4a' files.
- You can download the result as a '.wav' file.
- 4 different effects you can toggle on/off.


## Effects Explained:

- Reverse – Flips your audio backward for eerie or surreal effects. Works great on spoken words, screams, or sustained sounds. Use it to create unnatural build-ups or creepy reversed speech.

- Pitch Shift – Lowers the pitch for a deeper, heavier voice or tone. Great for turning a normal voice into a monstrous or demonic version. Use on vocals, instruments, or sound effects to make them sound darker.

- Distortion – Adds grit, harshness, and growling overdrive. Transforms clean audio into something raw and aggressive. Excellent for screams, instruments, or any sound you want to push into chaos.

- Reverb – Adds echo and space, like shouting in a haunted cathedral or cave. Makes short sounds feel larger or more dramatic. Useful for vocals, drums, or anything needing a ghostly or cinematic atmosphere.

This web app is a simpler version of the bigger brother AUDIO SATANIZER 666 thats on my itch.io page that comes with 16 effects and more power to choose. The Mini edition merely focuses on making any audio file sound like Satan, having the speciality of a Pitch Shift effect that doesn't slow down the audio - which isn't possible in the full big edition.


## How to Use

First, open Index.html in your web browser (firefox, brave, librewolf, chrome, etc).

1. Drop in your audio.
2. Choose your effects. (optional, the defaults are great for instant satan mode)
3. Click 'Satanify'.
4. Listen to the preview and download if you like it.

If you want to convert your audio files to lighter file formats like .MP3 or .OGG that are more easily shareable, then use Fre:AC, a freeware audio converter that can convert all your audio files from .WAV format to anything you like, automatically, in bulk, for free, rapidly.
